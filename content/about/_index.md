title: About me

Hello and welcome to my web page. I use it just as a place where to showcase things that I work on on my spare time. I am an economist by trade and a Data Scientist by profession, currently living in Uruguay (my place of birth...thou I lived many year in Argentina). I have worked both on academia and on the private sector, and I teach statistics at the University.

Most of the work I upload here are data visualizations that I've created using different tools. I also provide links to my Shiny Apps and some old class notes from a few school classes that others might find useful.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have questions or would like to collaborate on Open Source data viz projects. I run a data viz blog with some friends called UnaImagen.uy which is all about making national data available. You can check out our work [here](https://www.unaimagen.uy/). I try posting in English here so that the content is available to a wider audience, but does posts that I also share with UnaImagen will probably be in Spanish.
