title: About me
---

Hello and welcome to my web page. I use it just as a place where to showcase things that I've worked on in my spare time. I am an economist by trade and a Data Scientist by profession. I have worked both in academia and in the private sectorm. I currently live in Germany and work as a Product Analyst at Delivery Hero.

Most of the work I upload here are data visualizations that I've created using different tools, or learning materials about different technologies and data-related topics. I also provide links to my Shiny Apps and some class notes from university courses that others might find useful. Some are from when I took those courses as a student, some are my TA notes from teaching.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have questions or would like to collaborate on Open Source data viz projects. You can find my complete Résumé [here](https://rpubs.com/daczarne/760203).
